**For this assignment, Java has been selected as the programming language for its balance of simplicity and expressiveness, providing a suitable platform to showcase the implementation of lexical and syntax analysis. In the lexical analysis phase, the source code undergoes tokenization, leveraging regular expressions and finite automata to identify keywords, identifiers, literals, and other language constructs. This process results in the generation of a well-defined sequence of tokens, forming the basis for subsequent analyses. Transitioning to syntax analysis, the token stream produced by lexical analysis is parsed using a recursive descent parser. This parser, known for its clarity in handling grammar rules, facilitates the generation of an abstract syntax tree (AST). The report systematically documents the implementation of both lexical and syntax analyses, providing insight into the compilation process within the context of the Java programming language.**
